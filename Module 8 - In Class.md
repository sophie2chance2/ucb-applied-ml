### Dimensionality Reduction
- Principle component analysis (PCA)

## Clustering
![](Pasted%20image%2020240227164847.png)
- Centeroid based Â©
	- based on use of archetypes (k-means)
- Hierarchical clustering (b)
	- Agglomerative (bottom up)
	- Divisive (top down)
- Spectral clustering
	- Relies on the notion of the spectrum (eigenvalues) of a similarity matrix of the data to reduct the data dimensions before clustering

Text data - TFIDF w/ T-SNE w/ PCA

0<R<=N 
- If R is close to N then you can easily recover the full matrix
- If R is closer to 0 then you won't be able to predict as well
