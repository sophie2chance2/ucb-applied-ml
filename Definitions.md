| Ngram | Sequence of n words that we treat as a unit | [[Module 1 - Course Overview#Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence]] |
| Machine Learning | Algorithms improve through experience with data, distinct for its adaptability |  |
| Artificial Intellegence | Encompasses any technique enabling machines to mimic human behavior, broader than machine learning. | [[Module 1 - Course Overview#Artificial Intelligence]] |
| Deep Learning | Specialized in processing large, complex datasets using multi-layered neural networks, a deeper subset of machine learning. | [[Module 1 - Course Overview#Deep Learning]] |
| Supervised Learning | Relies on labeled datasets to train algorithms, making it specific for prediction based on known examples. | [[Module 1 - Course Overview#Supervision]] |
| Unsupervised Learning | Identifies patterns or structures in unlabeled data, unique for its ability to find hidden insights without guidance. | [[Module 1 - Course Overview#Supervision]] |
| Reinforcement Learning | Involves learning to make sequences of decisions by trial and error, distinct for its focus on sequential decision-making and reward-based | [[Module 1 - Course Overview#Supervision]] |
| Function | Takes some input (x) applies a transformation f(x) and creates an output y | [[Module 1 - Course Overview#What is a function?]] |
| Generalization | Capability to learn from some examples in a way that transfers to new examples | [[Module 1 - Course Overview#Generalization]] |
| Ocram's Razor | All things being equal, the simpler explanation is better | [[Module 1 - Course Overview#Generalization]] |
| Overfitting | The model has learned to fit the training model too well, at the expense of generalization | [[Module 1 - Course Overview#Generalization]] |
