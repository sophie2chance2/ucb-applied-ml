- Linear decision maker
- Fixed before/after
- Precision
	- How precise do you want to be?
	- Airport
		- Do not want anything to slip through the cracks
	- Choose one side (find weapons) that you are deciding how precise you want it to be.

- Invariance: Rotational Invariance - If you turn the number on its side will the model still work?
	- Centered and oriented correctly is important for model to work
- Important to see that the loss is going down, that means it is learning
	- Sometimes the loss will plateau, but that doesn't mean it is done learning. Could have a breakthrough at any point
- Once you train too much you start overfitting ![[Pasted image 20240130165401.png]]
