- Need to make sure you are finding the global min, not the local min
- ![[Pasted image 20240116162254.png]]
- Need to jump up pretty far to run down to find the true bottom. 
- Deep learning makes it easier, more stretched out

	- Most cutting edge: there can be multiple global minima 
- Measurement
- How big steps are
	- Step sizes can change based on the situation
	- Steps get smaller the closer you are to the optimum
- Stopping criteria
- SDG examples are equally weighted
- * Epochs
	* 5 is a good number
	* smaller datasets need more epochs
	* going through the FULL dataset without necessarily hitting every data point
* Shuffle data in pre-processing so that there aren't errors from the way that the data was collected
* You never know how many epochs you need. You may give up one step too short
* Efficiency is important - try many different options in order to do well
* Transformers solve most issues
	* Build transformers to not get fired
